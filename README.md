# BiometricApp
An investigation into biometrics on Android. FYI face biometrics is only available on Android 10+. And from my experience of using Android, I've never known an app to ask me for the option to use my face as a password.

A biometric app that decouples the biometric functionality from the activity so that it can be reused.
